    "Warqa pastry (sometimes referred to as \"brick pastry\") is an essential Moroccan ingredient, used to make a number of sweet and savory pastries and dishes. Thin sheets of pastry are cooked by \"painting\" the batter onto a hot pan.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pot of water is brought to boil with a metal pan placed on top. The top surface of the pan is exposed to ambient conditions (air and walls at  ùëáùë†ùë¢ùëüùëü ). Once the system reaches a steady temperature, thin layers of the batter are painted on the pan surface one at a time, then removed and stacked to form the pastry. For now, let's neglect the cooking process and focus on the steady-state temperatures in the system prior to painting the batter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to understand the steady state temperature on the top and bottom surface of the pan. To do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a control volume around the pan.  Include arrows to indicate heat transfer mechanisms to/from the pan.\n",
    "3. Evaluate an energy balance on the pan including the appropriate rate equations for each mechanism of heat transfer. List all assumptions as you analyze the energy balance.\n",
    "4. Find a relation between the surface temperature on the top and bottom surfaces of the pan based on the concept of thermal resistances.\n",
    "5. Identify any additional data (properties, dimensions, etc.) are needed to solve this equation.\n",

    "NASA‚Äôs Parker solar probe, which is currently flying to the Sun, is enabled by a collection of some of the best heat transfer technologies. The surface facing the sun is a thermal protection system that needs to maximize the reflection of the sunlight and survive high temperature. For this purpose, the side facing the sun is coated with a special opaque coating with a high reflectivity to sunlight of $\\rho _s$and high emissivity $\\epsilon _c$ for the radiation emitted in the longer wavelength range corresponding to its operating temperature. Sunlight of intensity $G_{Sun}$ is incident on the heat shield surface. All other surfaces have emissivities of $\\epsilon _o$and are exposed to deep space, which you may assume is at  0ùêæ . Assume the solar probe surface is at $T_s$ (spatially uniform).\n",

    "## Problem 2 - Conduction and Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to measure the heat transfer coefficient  ‚Ñé  involves heating one end of a metal rod and exposing the other end to convection. Multiple thermocouples along the length of the rod quantify the heat flow rate and can be extrapolated to estimate the surface temperature. The cylindrical surface of the rod is well insulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the schematic below of one such experiment. The temperature is measured at 3 points along a 1 cm diameter, 14 cm long aluminum rod [T(2cm)=$120^{\\circ}$C,  $T(7cm)=110^{\\circ} C$, and  T(12cm)=$100^{\\circ}$C]. The left end is exposed to convection with a freestream temperature of $20^{\\circ}$C.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/HW1_2_1.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the thermal conductivity of the aluminum. Cite your source.\n",
    "2. Calculate the heat flow through the aluminum rod in W.\n",
    "3. Estimate the surface temperature of the rod at  ùë•=14  cm.\n",
    "4. Calculate the heat transfer coefficient  ‚Ñé .\n",
    "5. On one experiment, you forget to include the insulation along the perimeter of the rod, so the perimeter is exposed to convection as well. Sketch the temperature profile along the axis of the rod ( ùëá(ùë•) ) for this case in comparison to the given data for the insulated case.\n",

    "## Problem 3 - Convection - Internal Flow\n",

    "Hot water through a coil of tubing is submerged in an ice bath. The tubing has an internal diameter of  D=10  mm. The fluid enters at temperature  $T_{m,i}=95^{\\circ}C$ and must exit at $T_{m,o}=5^{\\circ}C$. Assume the surface of the thin-walled pipe is uniformly at  $T_o=0^{\\circ}C$ and the flow is fully developed. You may assume the section of the tubing outside the bath is well insulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fluid properties for pipe flow are evaluated at  $\\overline{T_m}=\\frac{T_{m,i}+T_{m,o}}{2}$ . Use saturated water tables to find the thermal conductivity, viscosity, density, and heat capacity of water at  $\\overline{T_m}$. Cite your source.\n",
    "2. The cutoff between laminar and turbulent flow for pipes is  $Re_D=2300$. Calculate cutoff mass flow rate between laminar and turbulent flow ($\\dot{m_c}$  in kg/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume a mass flow rate of 50% the cutoff between laminar and turbulent flow ($\\dot{m}=0.5\\dot{m_c}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the total energy lost by the hot water as it flows through the pipe (in W). (Do not use h to calculate this value)\n",
    "4. For fully developed laminar flow, the $Nu_D = \\frac{hD}{k_f}$ is a constant. Assuming the ice bath maintains the surface temperature of the pipe at $T_s = T_o$ uniformly: $Nu_D = 3.66$ Calculate the heat transfer coefficient h.\n",
    "5. Determine the length of the pipe required to lower the mean temperature of the fluid to $5^{\\circ}$C. For internal flow with a constant surface temperature, Newton's law of cooling uses the log-mean temperature difference to find the heat transferred from the surface to the fluid:\n",
    "  - $q=hA\\Delta T_{lm}$ where:\n",
    "    - $\\Delta T_{lm}=\\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\log{\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2}}}$\n",
    "    - $\\Delta T_1=T_s-T_{m,i}$\n",
    "    - $\\Delta T_2 = T_s-T_{m,o}$\n",
    "6. At a particular point along the flow, the mean temperature is $50^{\\circ}$C, calculate the local heat flux ($q''$ in $W/m^2$) from the surface to the fluid at this point along the flow. Note, Newton's law of cooling applies as $q''=h(T_s-T_m(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 4 - Radiation and Convection\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a vertical metal plate (0.5 m height and 0.5 m width) suspended in ambient air at $22^{\\circ}$C. The plate has an emissivity of 1 and the surroundings are also at $22^{\\circ}$C. Both surfaces of the plate are exposed to both radiation and convection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming an average surface temperature of $32^{\\circ}$C:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the air properties at the film temperature $T_f = \\frac{T_s+T_{\\infty}}/2$.\n",
    "2. Estimate the convection losses.\n",
    "  - The $\\overline{Nu}_L = \\frac{\\overline{h}L}{k}$ for free convection depends on the Rayleigh number\n",
    "  - $Ra_L=\\frac{g\\beta (T_s-T_{\\infty}L^3}{v\\alpha}$, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 $m/s^2$) and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{T_f}$ for an ideal gas) as $\\overline{Nu}_L=.59Ra_L^{1/4}$.\n",
    "3. Estimate the radiation heat losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the impact of varying surface temperature. You may continue to use the fluid properties at the film temperature from (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate and plot the heat losses (convection, radiation, and total) as a function of surface temperature from $25 - 50^{\\circ}$C."
