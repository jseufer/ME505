    "Warqa pastry (sometimes referred to as \"brick pastry\") is an essential Moroccan ingredient, used to make a number of sweet and savory pastries and dishes. Thin sheets of pastry are cooked by \"painting\" the batter onto a hot pan.\n",

Once the system reaches a steady temperature, thin layers of the batter are painted on the pan surface one at a time, then removed and stacked to form the pastry. For now, let's neglect the cooking process and focus on the steady-state temperatures in the system prior to painting the batter.\n",
